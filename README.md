# Maze Solver using A* Algorithm

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements the A* (A-Star) search algorithm to find the shortest path in a maze.

The maze is represented as a grid where:
- 0 = Free path
- 1 = Wall/Obstacle

The algorithm finds the shortest path from the start point to the goal point using Manhattan distance as a heuristic.

## 🚀 Features
- Finds shortest path efficiently
- Handles blocked paths
- Uses A* algorithm (AI-based search)
- Simple and easy-to-understand implementation

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
A* Search Algorithm with Manhattan Distance heuristic.
